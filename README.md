# Predicting-Software-Bugs-using-ML-algorithms

Since the field of software engineering is expanding; it is vital to prevent the software from being faulty. 
Though software bug prediction has many benefits, like increasing reliability and quality, it is arduous to construct a model to predict software bugs. 
In this project, we apply machine learning algorithms, namely: Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na√Øve Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR), and then make a comparative analysis of it. 
We used these algorithms for the PROMISE Software Engineering Repository Datasets.
